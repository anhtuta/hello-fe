# Blog data

This folder is our blog data, using markdown. We can create a NodeJS function to parse these markdown files to HTML post.

We'll store the blog content in the file system, but it’ll work if the content is stored elsewhere (e.g. database or Headless CMS)

In this lesson, you’ll learn about:

- Next.js’ pre-rendering feature.
- The two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering.
- Static Generation with data, and without data.
- `getStaticProps` and how to use it to import external blog data into the index page.
- Some useful information on `getStaticProps`
